# SpikeTrap

### Set traps, catch bad frames.

An enhanced CPU profiler module for Unity Editor with pluggable frame filters, visual highlight strips, AI-driven profiling automation, and marked-frame collection.

## Why SpikeTrap?

Unity's built-in CPU module is a **rolling buffer** — it keeps the last 300-2000 frames and silently discards everything older. At 60fps that's 5-33 seconds of history.

SpikeTrap adds two layers on top:

- **Recording mode** — the standard profiler keeps running, but SpikeTrap adds filter highlight strips, prev/next navigation, pause on match, and log on match. You can spot spikes at a glance without changing how recording works.
- **Collect mode** — set your filter thresholds, press **Collect**, and just play your game. SpikeTrap captures only the frames that matter in the background. No need to stare at the profiler — come back when you're done and save the results.

### Comparison

| | Native CPU Module | SpikeTrap (Recording) | SpikeTrap (Collect) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frame retention** | ❌ Rolling buffer (300-2000) | ❌ Same rolling buffer | ✅ Only matched frames, no limit |
| **10 min @ 60fps** (36K frames) | ❌ Loses 95%+ | ❌ Same, but spikes highlighted | ✅ Keeps only ~20 spikes |
| **Rare spike (1/10,000)** | ❌ Overwritten before you see it | ⚠️ Caught if still in buffer | ✅ Captured automatically |
| **Filter types** | ❌ None | ✅ Spike, GC, Search, custom | ✅ Same filters drive capture |
| **Visual indicators** | ❌ None | ✅ Color-coded strips + nav | ✅ Same + "Collecting..." overlay |
| **Filter composition** | ❌ N/A | ✅ Match Any / Match All | ✅ Same logic drives capture |
| **Pause & log on match** | ❌ None | ✅ Auto-pause and/or log | ✅ Available |
| **Automation API** | ❌ Low-level `ProfilerDriver` | — | ✅ `SpikeTrapApi` fire-and-forget |
| **Output** | ⚠️ `.data` (all frames, rolling) | ⚠️ Same | ✅ `.data` (matched only, mergeable) |
| **Hierarchy view** | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Same | ✅ Same |

### How Collect Mode Works

Set your filter thresholds, press **Collect**, and play your game normally. SpikeTrap evaluates each frame against your active filters in real-time — only frames that match (spike threshold exceeded, GC allocation too high, specific marker found) are saved to temporary `.data` files. When you're done, press **Save** to merge them into a single file.

A 100-minute session producing 360,000 frames might save only 50 spike frames — each with full call-stack detail, ready for analysis. You don't lose data to the rolling buffer, and you don't need to watch the profiler while it runs.

This also makes Collect mode ideal for AI-driven profiling. The entire workflow — start collecting, wait, stop, save, analyze — maps to simple `SpikeTrapApi` calls with no frame-by-frame polling or buffer management. An AI agent can kick off a profiling session, let the game run, and retrieve pre-sorted results with marker names already resolved.

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3+

## Features

### Built-in Frame Filters

| Filter | What it detects | Strip color |
|---|---|---|
| **Spike** | Frames exceeding a CPU time threshold (ms/s) | Green |
| **GC** | Frames exceeding a GC allocation threshold (KB/MB) | Red |
| **Search** | Frames containing a named profiler sample (case-insensitive substring) | Orange |

Each filter strip includes prev/next navigation buttons to jump between matched frames.

### Collect Marked Frames

Record only frames that match active filters into `.data` files. During collection, the profiler chart and details area show a "Collecting..." overlay. Save the collected frames as a merged profile when done.

### Pause & Log on Match

- **Pause**: Automatically pause play mode when any active filter matches a frame.
- **Log**: Log full call-stack details for matched frames to the console.

### Screenshot Preview

Displays per-frame screenshots captured by the [ScreenshotToUnityProfiler](https://github.com/wotakuro/ScreenshotToUnityProfiler) runtime package. Screenshots persist while scrubbing through frames without screenshot data, and clear on new recording or file load.

```csharp
using SpikeTrap.Runtime;

// Start capturing (default: quarter resolution)
SpikeTrapApi.InitializeScreenshotCapture();

// Or specify scale (0.5 = half resolution)
SpikeTrapApi.InitializeScreenshotCapture(0.5f);

// Custom compression
SpikeTrapApi.InitializeScreenshotCapture(0.25f, TextureCompress.JPG_BufferRGB565);

// Custom capture routine (e.g., capture a specific camera instead of screen)
SpikeTrapApi.InitializeScreenshotCapture(captureBehaviour: target =>
{
    Camera.main.targetTexture = target;
    Camera.main.Render();
    Camera.main.targetTexture = null;
});

// Stop capturing and release resources
SpikeTrapApi.DestroyScreenshotCapture();
```

## Custom Filters

Create your own filters by extending `FrameFilterBase` and registering via `SpikeTrapApi`:

```csharp
using SpikeTrap.Editor;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyFilter : FrameFilterBase
{
    public override Color HighlightColor => Color.cyan;
    public override bool IsActive => /* your condition */;
    public override bool Matches(in CachedFrameData frameData)
    {
        // Pure managed matching logic — no Unity API calls needed
        // Must be thread-safe — called from Parallel.For
    }
}

// Register (e.g., from an editor script or [InitializeOnLoad] constructor)
SpikeTrapApi.RegisterCustomFilterFactory(() => new MyFilter());
```

## Scripting API

`SpikeTrap.Editor.SpikeTrapApi` and `SpikeTrap.Runtime.SpikeTrapApi` static classes provide the API for profiling, custom filters, and screenshot capture:

```csharp
using SpikeTrap.Editor;

// Start collecting spike frames (>33ms)
SpikeTrapApi.StartCollecting(spikeThresholdMs: 33f);

// Stop and save matched frames (await to know when the file is on disk)
await SpikeTrapApi.StopCollectingAndSaveAsync("/path/to/spikes.data");

// Or stop without saving (discard captured frames)
SpikeTrapApi.StopCollecting();

// Analyze cached data (no active view needed)
FrameSummary[] spikes = SpikeTrapApi.GetSpikeFrames(33f);
foreach (var s in spikes)
    Debug.Log(s); // "Frame 296: 2038.40ms, GC 5.7KB | NavMeshManager=1953.89ms, ..."
```

## AI Agents & Claude Skills

SpikeTrap is designed code-first: every UI action has an `SpikeTrapApi` equivalent, results come back pre-sorted with marker names already resolved, and analysis works on the static cache without driving the UI. This makes it straightforward to drive from AI agents (Claude Code, uLoop MCP, editor scripts).

The package ships two Claude Code skills under `.claude/skills/` that wrap common workflows as slash commands:

- **`/spike-trap`** — runs an end-to-end profiling session: enters play mode, collects matched frames, stops, saves to `.data`, and summarizes top bottlenecks by marker name. Also has an `analyze` mode that skips profiling and reports against already-cached data.
- **`/qa-test`** — runs the SpikeTrap QA suite (52 tests across 10 suites: API contracts, collect lifecycle, filter accuracy, threshold updates, discard flow, domain reload survival, marker resolution, UI checks).

```
/spike-trap profile 33ms 10 seconds
/spike-trap analyze 16ms
/qa-test full
```

Why the API works well for agents:

- **Session-scoped, not frame-scoped** — `StartCollecting` / `StopCollectingAndSaveAsync` wrap a full capture. The agent starts, waits, stops — no frame-by-frame iteration or buffer management.
- **Pre-sorted, pre-resolved results** — `GetSpikeFrames` returns frames worst-first with `TopMarkerNames` already resolved. No `ProfilerDriver` plumbing on the agent side.
- **Analysis without UI interaction** — `GetSpikeFrames` and `GetCachedFrameSummaries` read the static cache, so agents can inspect a loaded `.data` file without driving the Profiler window.
- **Session-aware cache** — reloading the same `.data` reuses its cache, so repeated `load → analyze` cycles don't re-extract.
